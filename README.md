# Degree Classification Engine (Java)

A rule-based Java system that calculates a student’s degree outcome from grades and profile rules, with automated unit tests to validate correctness.

## What this project demonstrates
- **Rule-based decision logic** (classification and degree outcomes)
- **Unit testing with JUnit** to validate expected behaviour
- **Edge case handling** (boundary grades, invalid inputs, missing data)
- Clear separation between core logic and test logic

## Tech Stack
- Java
- JUnit (unit testing)

## How to run
1. Open the project in Eclipse (or any Java IDE)
2. Run the test classes (JUnit)

## Notes
This project was built as part of my Testing & Verification learning and focuses on correctness, testing discipline, and robust decision logic.
